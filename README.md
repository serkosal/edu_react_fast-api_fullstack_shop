# Full stack simple E-commerce site (React + FastAPI).

> [!WARNING]
> This project was created for educational purposes and should not be used in production. 

## ðŸŽ¯ Project Goal
This project is not intended to be a fully production-ready e-commerce platform. Instead, it serves as a personal learning exerciseâ€”bringing together various technologies and fragmented knowledge into a single, functional full-stack application.

The focus is on understanding how components work together (frontend, backend, database, API, deployment) rather than on perfecting every aspect of scalability, security, or performance.

## Functionality

- [ ] Responsive, mobile-first user interface
- [ ] Registration and login (authentication)
- [ ] web-interface for CRUD operations for products, user profiles and etc
- [ ] Product search with autocomplete and filters 
- [ ] Ability to add/remove products to the shopping cart
- [ ] Persist cart across sessions (local storage or backend)
- [ ] Email notifications (e.g., registration, order confirmation)
- [ ] Dark/light theme toggle
- [ ] ??? Integration with payment gateways (e.g., Stripe or PayPal)
- [ ] ??? Multilingual support
- [ ] ??? Analytics dashboard for admin
